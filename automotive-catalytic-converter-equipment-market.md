<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Catalytic Converter Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three-way Catalysts (TWC)</li><li>Lean NOx Catalysts (LNC)</li><li>Lean NOx Trap (LNT)</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)</li><li>Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive catalytic converter equipment market consists of several key types. Three-way catalysts (TWC) reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides in gasoline engines. Lean NOx catalysts (LNC) target nitrogen oxide emissions in lean-burn engines. Lean NOx traps (LNT) temporarily store NOx for later reduction under richer conditions. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) uses urea to convert NOx to nitrogen and water, primarily in diesel engines. Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) facilitate the oxidation of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in diesel exhaust.</p></p>
