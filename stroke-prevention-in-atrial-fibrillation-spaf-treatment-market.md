<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral Direct Thrombin Inhibitors</li><li>Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) treatment includes two main types of anticoagulants: Oral Direct Thrombin Inhibitors and Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors. Oral Direct Thrombin Inhibitors, such as dabigatran, target thrombin directly, reducing clot formation. Conversely, Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitors like rivaroxaban and apixaban inhibit factor Xa, another key protein in the coagulation pathway. Both classes offer effective alternatives to traditional warfarin, providing simpler dosing regimens and fewer dietary restrictions for patients with atrial fibrillation.</p></p>
