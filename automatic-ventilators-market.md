<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automatic ventilators market includes two primary types: positive pressure mechanical ventilation and negative pressure mechanical ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers air into the patient's lungs, creating a higher pressure than the atmospheric pressure, which is commonly used in hospitals for conditions requiring respiratory support. In contrast, negative pressure ventilation draws air out of a chamber surrounding the patient, creating a vacuum effect that expands the lungs. Both types are essential for managing respiratory failure and ensuring effective patient breathing support.</p></p>
