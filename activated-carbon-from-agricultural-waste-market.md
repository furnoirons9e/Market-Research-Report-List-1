<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Activated Carbon from Agricultural Waste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Particles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The activated carbon market from agricultural waste can be categorized into two primary types: powder and particle forms. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is finely milled, offering a large surface area ideal for high absorption applications like water treatment and air filtration. In contrast, granular activated carbon (GAC) consists of larger particles, providing slower absorption but better structural integrity, making it suitable for industrial processes and gas purification. Both types leverage renewable agricultural byproducts, promoting sustainability and reducing waste.</p></p>
