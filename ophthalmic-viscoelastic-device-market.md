<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cohesive OVDs</li><li>Dispersive OVDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ophthalmic viscoelastic device (OVD) market is primarily categorized into cohesive and dispersive OVDs. Cohesive OVDs are designed to maintain space in the anterior chamber during cataract surgery, offering better visibility and maintaining tissue separation through their high viscosity and cohesive properties. Dispersive OVDs, on the other hand, are formulated to provide protection to the corneal endothelium and prevent trauma by dispersing evenly across tissues. Both types play crucial roles in facilitating safe and effective ocular surgical procedures.</p></p>
