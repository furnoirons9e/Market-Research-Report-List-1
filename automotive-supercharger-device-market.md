<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-screw Supercharger</li><li>Centrifugal Supercharges</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive supercharger device market primarily comprises two main types: twin-screw superchargers and centrifugal superchargers. Twin-screw superchargers use two interlocking screws to compress air, providing high efficiency and improved performance at lower RPMs, making them suitable for applications requiring quick throttle response. In contrast, centrifugal superchargers utilize a spinning impeller to draw in air and increase pressure, excelling at high RPMs and often featuring a compact design. Both types enhance engine performance by increasing air intake for better combustion.</p></p>
